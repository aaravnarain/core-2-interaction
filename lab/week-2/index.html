            <h4> Moss lawns are lawns composed of moss, which occur naturally, but can also be cultivated like grass lawns.
   Moss lawns are drought-tolerant and rarely need misting once established (the average US grass lawn uses a hundred times as much water). They do not require mowing, fertilizing, or other amendments, and grow on almost any substrate (apart from metal), and at any soil pH and light level. They can grow under conifers, swallowing the needles, but fallen broad deciduous leaves will kill them if not removed. They can be walked on but not scuffed.</h4>

            <summary><strong>Uses</strong></summary>
            <p>Mosses are squishy and compress without being damaged, but they are easily torn by tension. Moss lawns can therefore stand being walked on, but not being scuffed. They tend to be too moist to sit upon comfortably.</p>
            <div>
                <p>Moss lawns can be used as a living mulch; they retain moisture, do not become compacted, and do not require annual replacement. A moss layer can act as a physical barrier to prevent germination of vascular plants. Moss also hosts symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, like clover, and when mosses are dried and wetted, they release nitrogen and carbon into the soil. Mosses reduce losses of soil moisture to evapotranspiration; when saturated, mosses reduce water infiltration into soil. Mosses thermally insulate the soil.
Moss lawns may be used to cover green roofs. They are also used as an erosion-control groundcover, along the banks of watercourses, under flowing water, and on steep slopes.</p>

            <summary><strong>Visual effects</strong></summary>
            <p>Traditional Japanese garden aesthetics avoids contrasts, symmetries and groupings that would create points which dominate visual attention, instead creating scenes in which visual salience is evenly distributed across the field of view. Stand-out colours, textures, objects, and groups are avoided. The size of objects, groupings, and the spacings between them are arranged to be self-similar at multiple spatial scales; that is, they produce similar patterns when scaled up or down (zoomed in or out). This property is also seen in fractals and many natural scenes. This self-similarity may be extended all the way down to the scale of surface textures. The mottled texture and colour of moss (like that of rocks) can be used as part of such self-similar, evenly-distributed-salience designs. Moss is considered to express a wabi-sabi aesthetic.</p>

            <summary><strong>Maintenance</strong></summary>
            <p>In the wild, mosses may naturally form a continuous lawn under conifers; the more upright mosses, such as Hylocomium splendens, can grow over falling needles. For mosses not adapted to a continuous fall of needles, though, needles can cause mould.[8] Deciduous trees are quite different; deciduous leaves are wider, and they fall abruptly. While some mosses grow under deciduous trees in nature, a blanket of dead leaves or other debris can smother a moss lawn. Leaving the leaves on the moss short-term does not harm the moss, but long-term, most leaves should be kept off the moss. In traditional Japanese gardens, moss under deciduous trees is swept clear with a broom; more modernly, a leaf blower may be used. It is also possible to temporarily lay down netting (but not metal netting, which is toxic to moss). The shed leaves land on the netting, and when the leaves have finished falling, netting and leaves can be rolled up together[8] and removed.

                Moss lawns do not require fertilizer or other soil amendments, as moss lacks a root system. Moss lawns do not need mowing, although there are a few species which can be mown.</p>
            <div>
                <p>While moss requires some moisture, its water demands are moderate; one percent or less of the water needed by an average US grass lawn. It does not benefit from deep watering. Moss lawns are drought-resistant after they have become established; they are among the most drought-resistant garden plants. The moss will become dormant in less favourable conditions. Moss thus generally only needs watering until it is established. When rehydrated, it recovers and becomes green within seconds. Misting for a minute or two a day will keep a moss lawn green. Overwatering can kill moss; most species cannot stand being waterlogged, though some (like Sphagnum) require it, and others grow only underwater.
                    Mosses stay green at moderately sub-freezing temperatures, and thus remain green all winter in many climates. A layer of snow will insulate it; it may grow under light snow cover. Some mosses depend on seasonal snow cover.</p>

            <summary><strong>Conditions</strong></summary>
            <p>The mosses can live in a broader range of habitats than the flowering plants can. Different species of mosses have very different needs, and needs quite different from flowering plants. They are, however, often excluded by competition from flowering plants, and thus generally grow in places where flowering plants can't.</p>
            <div>
                <p>Moss lawns can grow in anything from blazing sun to full shade, but different species are specialized to different light levels. Annual variations in sun exposure need to be taken into account; space under deciduous trees may be seasonally sunny, and require sun-tolerant species.</p>

        <p>Mosses do not grow roots into the soil, but most mosses need to attach rhizomes to the substrate in order to grow and remain in place; this is assisted by clearing and smoothing a lawn substrate and fairing a fillet between vertical and horizontal surfaces. Loose debris and sharp angles discourage moss growth. While preparing for the moss, curves and mounds may be sculpted (this is easiest in clayey soil), and a hose may be used to erode the edges of shapes. Established moss can resist flowing water and secure steep slopes. While some beach species specialize in growing on shifting sands, and may grow on sandy, salty roadside soil in cities, most mosses are very slow to colonize loose-shifting surfaces. Depressions in moss lawns may fill with debris.
            There are moss species that grow on almost any substrate, including rocks, wood, or soil. The rhizoids do grow into any soil, in some cases about as deep as the moss is tall, in order to hold the moss in place. Generally, mosses does not absorb nutrients from the soil, so soil amendments do not benefit moss. Many mosses are ombrotrophic, fed by rain.</p>
