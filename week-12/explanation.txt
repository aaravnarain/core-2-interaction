For this website, I integrated the national weather API into the page to show the weather forecast for the next week : from tonight (Thursday) till next Thursday. The weather data is displayed as a title using the weather.name and then the temperature, wind speed, and short forecast are displayed below. For the visual representation, I used to circles displayed on the right side of the page next to each dataset, and the circles have been assigned particular colors depending on the short forecast (such as mostly sunny has a yellow circle and mostly clear has a white circle).
